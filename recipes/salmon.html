    <p><em>A cooked salmon portion from an Air-Fryer!!</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Salmon.</strong> I prefer to cook this salmon with skin on, as the fillet holds together more easily, and I find skin-on salmon yields more moist and flaky results than salmon with the skin removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Sugar or Honey.</strong> Brown sugar or honey gives the salmon the perfect amount of sweetness and helps it caramelize.</li>
        <li><strong>Dijon Mustard.</strong> Tangy, zippy, and pairs wonderfully with the brown sugar/honey and soy sauce.</li>    
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce.</strong> A salty umami bomb that coats the salmon in scrumptious flavor.</li>    
        <li><strong>Ginger.</strong> While optional, adding a pinch to make salmon with ginger gives the sauce a subtle, lively touch and, as this Soy Ginger Salmon shows, itâ€™s a stellar combo with the soy sauce.</li>    
        <li><strong>Garlic.</strong> A seafood flavor BFF (Garlic Salmon with Lemon Butter agrees).</li>   
    </ul>
   
    <h3>Step-by-Step Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry and Season. Pat the salmon dry to help it crisp, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir the Glaze Together. Spread the mixture over the salmon.</li>
        <li>Line Your Basket. For easy clean up, line the air fryer basket with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Start the salmon skin-side down.</li>
        <li>Cook. Air fry salmon at 400 degrees F for 6 to 11 minutes. ENJOY!</li>
    </ol>
