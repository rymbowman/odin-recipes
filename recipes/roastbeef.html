<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Beef Roast:</strong> I use a bottom round beef roast for this recipe. It shreds up nice and has way less fat to pick out before serving as a chuck roast does.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>Salt and pepper, as well as onion powder are the only seasonings you need.</li>
    <li><strong>Brown Gravy Packets:</strong> These help create amazing homemade gravy and add additional flavor to the overall meal.</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Adds the perfect amount of liquid for the cooking process to make gravy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step-by-Step Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place the roast into a 4-quart or larger slow cooker. Sprinkle a small amount of salt, pepper, and onion powder onto the beef.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl whisk together the gravy packets and water until smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour broth mixture over the roast.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook on LOW for 8-10 hours.</li>
    <li>When the cooking time is done, remove roast and place it on a plate. Shred meat and discard any fat. Cover with foil to keep warm.</li>
    <li>De-grease the gravy in the slow cooker. Add the shredded roast beef back into the gravy. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
