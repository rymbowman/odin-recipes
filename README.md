# odin-recipes

This was an Odin-Project assignment at the conclusion of our section on HTML. We were tasked with creating a recipe links page with 3 different recipes tagged from other files that we created. We worked on the basic structure of HTML with headings, images, paragraphs, lists, and links. This was also good practice for me to start submitting commits. I am still trying to conceptualize this topic of commits and such, but I think I am making progress in understanding this topic fully.
